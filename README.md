# GSM-and-RF-based-Irrigation-to-reduce-bandwidth
Abstract:

Agriculture serves as the primary livelihood for the majority of the Indian population and significantly 
impacts the nation's economy. However, the challenge of irrigation in arid regions or during periods of 
insufficient rainfall necessitates automation for optimal crop yield and remote management to ensure farmer safety.
The emergence of greenhouse-based modern agricultural practices has become imperative across India. This technology 
enables precise control of plant humidity and temperature, yet the variable atmospheric conditions within extensive
farmhouses pose difficulties in maintaining uniformity manually.

To address these challenges, a pioneering approach involves the use of Android
smartphones for irrigation system control, facilitating the maintenance of consistent
environmental conditions. Leveraging the Arduino Software Development Kit this application
capitalizes on the ubiquity of mobile phones in human life. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
capabilities in mobile phones are harnessed to create an innovative solution for irrigation control. Additionally, 
Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technology is employed to relay real-time field condition information to users
through SMS notifications, ensuring timely and informed decision-making in agriculture.
